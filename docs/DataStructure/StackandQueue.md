# [Day 3: Stacks and Queues](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pViJo3jAgve8OB_qHbircFv4lW214_9edoSmc5Yq6RA/edit?gid=0#gid=0?target=_blank)

* Concepts to Learn: Stacks (LIFO), Queues (FIFO), priority queues.
* Topics:
    * Push, pop, and peek operations in stacks.
    * Enqueue and dequeue operations in queues.
    * Real-life applications of stacks and queues (e.g., browser history, printer queues).
* Practice Problems:
    * Implement a stack using arrays or linked lists.
    * Check for balanced parentheses in an expression.
    * Implement a queue using two stacks.
* Resources:

## Stack
`A stack is a data structure that can hold many elements.`

* Think of a stack like a pile of pancakes.

* In a pile of pancakes, the pancakes are both added and removed from the top. So when removing a pancake, it will always be the last pancake you added. This way of organizing elements is called LIFO: Last In First Out.

Basic operations we can do on a stack are:
* `Push` Adds a new element on the stack.
* `Pop` Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
* `Peek` Returns the top element on the stack.
* `isEmpty` Checks if the stack is empty.
* `Size` Finds the number of elements in the stack.
